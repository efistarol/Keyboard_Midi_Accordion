## Keyboard_Midi_Accordion
Small Processing Script that allows you to use a standard Computer-Keyboard as an accordion MIDI-Controller. As of now only mac is supported.

# Installation
*mac*
1. Download the program
2. Go to "Audio MIDI Setup"
3. Window > Show MIDI Studio
4. Under IAC-Driver enable "Device is online"
5. Open the program and start jamming. It only works if the program window is activated because otherwise Logic (or any other DAW) will recieve keystrokes
