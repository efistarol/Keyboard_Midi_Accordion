# Keyboard_Midi_Accordion
Small Processing Script that allows you to use a standard Computer-Keyboard as an accordion MIDI-Controller. As of now only mac with a QWERTZU-keyboard layout is supported. However, you can easily change the key mapping in the lookUP() function.

## Installation
### *mac*
1. Download the program
2. You may have to authorize the installation in your system preferences
3. Go to "Audio MIDI Setup"
4. Window > Show MIDI Studio
5. Under IAC-Driver enable "Device is online"
6. Open the program and start jamming. It only works if the program window is activated because otherwise Logic (or any other DAW) will recieve keystrokes
